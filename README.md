Hi Everyone. This is a Java based application that will ask the user for their GMAIL login information. Using that, it will ask for list of numbers to send out emails in the form of text messages. Is an effective way to reach people who may not have email set up on their phones. I have a sample text file included within the folder, it is called numbers.txt. This is what will be used to scan the numbers. Please note, the app requires the document being read have at least one value already entered before using the add number method built within. The first number allows the program to identify it as the phone number directory. Please also note that the phone number will have to have the ending of the carriers specific gateway. AT&T for example is @txt.att.net. Just see the numbers file and it will make more sense.
